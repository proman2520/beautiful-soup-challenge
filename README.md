# beautiful-soup-challenge

In this repository, you will find the chromedriver.exe, required to interact with the Browser. The "Mars.csv" is where the dataframe is printed. 
part_1_mars_news_main.ipynb is the Jupyter Notebook where the website was scraped for its news headlines. part_2_mars_weather_main.ipynb is 
the Jupyter Notebook where the weather data was analyzed and graphed. template_part_1_mars.ipynb and template_part_2_mars.ipynb are the templates 
where I could cross-reference the outputs I had gotten. The parts where Eli aided during the lecture are denoted. I used AskBCS twice, but only 
in order to get the numbers precisely without the graphs (which I don't believe was required).

Let me know if there are any issues as usual. Thanks for taking the time to grade my assignment.
